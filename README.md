as PyBaMM.

# Getting Started

Before starting up the code, set up your virtual environment. The simplest way to do this is to enter the following commands in your terminal:

```
python3 -m venv venv
```

Next, activate your virtual environment:

`source venv/bin/activate`

With your virtual environment activate, install the required packages:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you are ready to go:

```
jupyter notebook
```
